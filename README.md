# Trap

> The Identity Trap: indexing algorithmically promoted identities that promise self-improvement, belonging, and purpose — but deliver chronic grievance, financial exploitation, and a pipeline toward extremism.
>

## Why

Algorithms don't just serve content — they construct identities. A teenager searching for gym advice gets served masculinity content. A lonely young man looking for community finds a world that explains his isolation as someone else's fault. A woman seeking simpler living gets channeled toward ethno-nationalism.

These aren't accidents. They're patterns. The same structural mechanism repeats across seemingly unrelated communities:

1. **Hook** — an emotional appeal that feels like insight
2. **Cost** — hidden damage that the identity obscures
3. **Pipeline** — a directed path toward deeper, more extreme identities

This project makes those patterns visible. It's a directed graph: nodes are identities, edges are the escalation pathways between them. Once you see the structure, you can recognize the trap — in yourself, in people you care about, or in the platforms that profit from it.

## Current status

🟡 **v0.1 — first public release.** Core data is complete. Content review, source citations, and JSON export are in progress.

| Metric | Count | Status |
|--------|-------|--------|
| Identities (nodes) | 52 | Complete — content review ongoing |
| Clusters | 7 | Stable |
| Pipeline connections (edges) | 125 | Complete — review ongoing |
| Terminal nodes | 6 | Complete |
| Deception tactics (vocabulary) | 14 | Stable |

**What's complete:**
- All 52 identity nodes across 7 clusters, each with hook, cost, tactics, timelines, and intervention
- 125 directed edges with strength and mechanism
- Schema covering nodes, edges, clusters, tag vocabulary, and tactics vocabulary
- `trap_depth` scale on all terminal nodes

**What's next:**
- Per-node source citations (`evidence_sources`)
- JSON export for visualization and content ops integration
- `methodology.md` and `sources.md`

See [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) for version history.

## Who this is for

- **Educators** — teaching media literacy, critical thinking, or digital citizenship
- **Parents** — understanding what their kids are encountering online
- **Researchers** — studying algorithmic radicalization, identity fusion, or digital extremism
- **Individuals** — recognizing patterns in their own media consumption or that of friends/family
- **Developers** — building tools, visualizations, or interventions based on this data

Each entity is a self-contained markdown file named by its slug (e.g., `DATA/nodes/red_piller.md`, `DATA/edges/red_piller__mgtow.md`).

## How to read the data

Each **node** (identity) contains:

| Field | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| Hook | The emotional appeal — what draws people in |
| Cost | The hidden damage — what it actually does |
| Tactics | Deception techniques used to recruit and retain |
| Pipeline to | Where it leads next (authoritative data in edges) |
| Risk level | 1–10 severity scale |
| Entry / Terminal | Whether this is a common starting point or a hard-to-escape destination |
| Trap depth | 1–5 escape difficulty for terminal nodes |
| Target demographics | Who is most vulnerable |
| Timeline | How fast the pipeline moves |
| Intervention | Breaking points, alternatives, resources |

Each **edge** (pipeline connection) contains:

| Field | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| From → To | Source and target identity |
| Strength | How reliably the transition occurs (high/medium/low) |
| Mechanism | What drives the movement between identities |

Each **tactic** (deception technique) contains a name and description of the manipulation mechanism, used across multiple identities.

See [SCHEMA.md](SCHEMA.md) for full field definitions.

## Content warning

This project describes manipulative, extremist, and violent ideologies for **educational purposes only**. The content includes:

- Descriptions of radicalization mechanisms
- References to white nationalism, antisemitism, and misogyny
- Discussion of suicide, self-harm, and violence

Reading about these identities does not mean endorsing them. If you recognize yourself in any profile, that's the point — and the intervention section is there for a reason.

If you or someone you know is in crisis:
- **988** (US Suicide & Crisis Lifeline)
- **116 123** (EU Samaritans)
